Title: Google Play Store Apps Analysis - Data Analysis Project



Description:

I recently worked on a data science project analyzing the Google Play Store Apps dataset. In this project, I explored various aspects of the dataset to gain insights into the app market.



The dataset, which I obtained from Kaggle, contains information about different apps on the Google Play Store, such as their categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, installs, prices, content ratings, genres, and more.



Throughout the project, I aimed to answer several key questions:



1-     What is the most expensive app on the store?

2-     Which genre has the highest number of apps?

3-     What is the average size of free and paid apps?

4-     What are the top 5 most expensive apps with a rating of 5?

5-     How many apps have more than 50,000 reviews?

6-     What is the average price of apps for each genre based on the number of installs?

7-     How many apps have a rating higher than 4.7, and what is their average price?

8-     How much revenue did Google earn from apps with 5,000,000+ installs?

9-     What are the maximum and minimum sizes for free and paid apps?

10-  Is there a correlation between app ratings, reviews, size, and price?

11-  How many apps are available for different content ratings?

12-  How many apps are compatible with Android version 4?

To perform the analysis, I utilized Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These libraries helped me in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.



I have shared the code and analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, which you can find on my LinkedIn profile. Feel free to check it out and explore the insights I derived from the dataset.



If you're interested in data analysis, app market analysis, or gaining insights from large datasets, I encourage you to have a look at my project. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss the project further.
